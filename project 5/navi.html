                <p>
                    Journaling is a bit like keeping a diary, but not like the one Adrian Mole used to keep, where he
                    talked about puberty
                    and girls, no. A journal is more of a collection of thoughts, feelings, goals, ambitions, gratitude
                    and whatever else
                    HELPS YOU.

                    A journal is still a very personal thing, but it’s not like talking to the teen angst version of
                    yourself, it’s more
                    like talking to the person who you are today or possibly even the one you want to become.

                    There are no hard and fast rules around journaling in my opinion; it should be a natural process
                    that helps get
                    everything that’s rattling around inside your mind, down on to a piece of paper.

                    You can create a journal that helps you achieve targets, show gratitude, set goals or simply as a
                    way of trying to make
                    sense of all those thoughts and feelings. Ultimately a journal will give you piece-of-mind, because
                    you’re sharing
                    everything that’s bottled up inside, with it; meaning it no longer stays bottled up inside.
